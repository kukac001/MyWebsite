                    I do not have a decade of experience as a Software Engineer
                    and sometimes suffer from Impostor Syndrome. But what I do
                    have are skills the cannot be taught. I take full ownership
                    of my work, far beyond my responsibilities. I do not wait
                    for people to tell me what to do and go seek for myself what
                    needs to be done. I am entrepreneurial, I get things done,
                    and I know at some point in the future, I will become the
                    best Software Engineer I can be. My one thing in life is to
                    be as efficient and effective as humanly possible.
